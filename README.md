# Java-Re-Learn
A beginner-friendly Java re-learn guide for people who already knows the basics, but want to level up more, and understand Java **more deeply**

This is NOT a "Hello World" tutorial.
This is for real learners who want the **real mental models** behind Java concepts

## 📘 What this book focuses on
- Java project structure (what actually matters)
- **Java Memory Model** (stack vs heap)
- Primitive vs reference types
- `==` vs `.equals()` (no confusion)
- Pass-by-value (explained properly)
- Encapsulation & access modifiers
- Constructors & `this`
- Object lifecycle + immutability
- Inheritance vs composition
- Polymorphism & dynamic dispatch
- Interfaces vs abstract classes
- Collections Framework (List / Set / Map)
- ArrayList vs LinkedList vs Vector
- HashSet vs LinkedHashSet vs TreeSet
- HashMap vs LinkedHashMap vs TreeMap
- Exceptions (checked vs unchecked)
- Generics + wildcards (`<? extends T>` / `<? super T>`)
- Streams API (from zero intuition → real usage)
- Tiny but important: functional interfaces, enum, Optional

## Who is this for
✅ You know Java basics already
✅ You want to deepen your **understanding**
✅ You want stupidly simple, direct explanations

So not recommended if you are completely new to programming

## Why I made this
I wrote this because most tutorials explain **what to type**, but not **why Java behaves in the way it does**.

This book is my "re-learn arc" — made to help others level up faster.
